# Create Generic Data Pipelines in YAML

There are a few other frameworks that do something similar, but nothing quite
like what I wanted. Implement your own pipeline stages which consume and
provide data types of your choosing, then configure the order of stages in a
YAML file. See `pipeline.yaml` and `IntegerStage/IntegerStage.py` for an
example.
